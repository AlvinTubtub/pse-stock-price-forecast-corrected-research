          The original prototype let a visitor upload a CSV and run a prediction directly in the browser. That
          flow depended on a Python backend (ARIMA/LSTM training and inference), which this deployment doesn&apos;t
          have — the frontend is 100% static and never executes Python, by design.

          Every forecast on this site is instead produced ahead of time by the scheduled GitHub Actions pipeline
          and published as JSON, so results are consistent, reviewable, and don&apos;t require running machine
          learning code on someone else&apos;s browser or a paid server.
